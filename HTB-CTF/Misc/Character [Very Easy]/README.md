# Character (<font color=green>Very Easy </font>)


## Description
Security through Induced Boredom is a personal favourite approach of mine. Not as exciting as something like The Fray, but I love making it as tedious as possible to see my secrets, so you can only get one character at a time!

## Skills Learned

- Writing a Python script to interact with a remote server over TCP

## Steps Taken
1. Connected to a remote service using IP and port via nc and Python sockets.
